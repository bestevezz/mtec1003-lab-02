----------
cd ..


==========
9. Try removing the directory called my_files using rmdir.

Write out the command that you used and what happened.
----------
//rmdir is for directories, while rm is for files

rmdir my_files 
rmdir: failed to remove 'my_files': Directory not empty





==========
10. Try removing the directory called my_files using rm.

Write out the command that you used and what happened.
----------
rm my_files 
rm: cannot remove 'my_files': Is a directory





==========
11. First: MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE mtec1003-lab-02 directory!
***If you accidentally delete your other files, you'll have to start over!!***

Force the removal of the directory and its files using the -rf flag

Use this command:

$ rm -rf my_files
(options r = recursive; f = skip confirmation)
----------
$ rm -rf my_files



==========
12. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1003-lab-02 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command called cat on the file to show its contents.

Describe what happened below.
----------
A lot of text showed up
//Note: Don't want to copy and paste since i went 10 seconds holding it down and it still wasnt halfway





==========
13. That was a lot of text.  Let's find ways to limit it.  Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------
$ head pg1232.txt
The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Prince, by Nicolo Machiavelli

Title: The Prince


==========
14. Using the same file again!

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use tail on the file to show the contents of the end of the file.

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below.
----------
$ tail pg1232.txt


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks


==========
15. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------
less pg1232.txt
//Note: Spacebar allows for the user to scroll down the file, while q returns you too the command center
//Note: More command does not work on gitbash


==========
16. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------
//Note: Less could be useful for reading a .txt file as a book that is long like this one.
//cat can be useful if you want to see the entire text in command center and the file is smaller
//tail can be useful for reading just the end of the text if there is important information
//head could be useful for checking the beginning of a file or to check if you have the correct text in the file


==========
17.  How many words are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the word count?
----------
$ wc -w pg1232.txt
52639 pg1232.txt


==========
18.  How many lines are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the line count?
----------
$ wc -l pg1232.txt
5063 pg1232.txt


==========
19.  Make sure you're in the books/other folder.  Copy all of the txt files from that folder to your home directory using wildcard matching.

Write the command that you used below.
----------
$ mv *.txt ~
//Note: Wasn't sure if this would work, I checked by going back and listing and it worked! Pretty cool to simplify it and not have to identify the folder



==========
Next: Save this file. Then, using your mouse or a Terminal command that you learned this week, MOVE this file into your "mtec1003-lab-02" folder.

And that's it! Now, go on to LAB 2 / PART 3...
